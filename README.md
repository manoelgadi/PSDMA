## About

This repository supports analytics education. It includes:

- Datasets (in `datasets/`)
- Exercises for class sessions (e.g. “SESSION 06 – Missing Values”, “SESSION 25 – Decision Trees”)  
- Supplemental files like spreadsheets  
- Illustrative examples of data cleaning, modeling, clustering, regression, etc.

The author, Manoel Gadi, is a professor in Business Analytics, with a background in banking, risk management, and Python. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

````

Here’s a quick overview:

- **datasets/** — raw data files used in classes  
- **SESSION XX ... .zip** — exercise sets (problems, data, answers)  
- Miscellaneous supporting Excel or CSV files  

You may optionally organize your sessions into subfolders per module or topic for clarity.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manoelgadi/PSDMA.git
cd PSDMA
````

Unzip or extract the exercise zip files for the sessions you’re working on.

---

## Usage

You can use the datasets and exercises as follows:

1. Import the datasets (e.g. via `pandas.read_csv` or `pd.read_excel`)
2. Work through the exercises using Python (or R / your preferred tool)
3. Compare with solution files (if included)
4. Use the files for instructional teaching, benchmarking, or personal practice in analytics

Some suggestions:

* Keep a working environment (Jupyter, VSCode, etc.) in sync with the `datasets/` folder
* Create your own notebooks or scripts for each session topic
* Version your solutions in a separate branch so you can keep teaching materials intact

---

## Prerequisites

While the repository itself is “data + exercises,” for using the datasets and performing analyses you’ll generally need:

* Python 3.x
* Common data science libraries:

  * `pandas`
  * `numpy`
  * `scikit-learn`
  * `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  * Optionally `statsmodels` or other analysis libraries
* (Optional) R for statistical exercises, if you prefer

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Some ideas:

* Add new sessions (e.g. time-series, neural networks)
* Clean up or modernize existing exercises
* Provide Jupyter notebooks with worked solutions
* Add automated versioning or a script to unzip and set up sessions
* Update the datasets or improve documentation

When contributing:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (e.g. `add-deep-learning-session`)
3. Commit and push your changes
4. Open a Pull Request — describe what you added or changed

Please ensure your additions maintain consistency in naming and structure.

If you like, I can generate a more polished README (with badges, sample outputs, Jupyter integration) and send you a ready-to-paste version. Do you want me to do that?
